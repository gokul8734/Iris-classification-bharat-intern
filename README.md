Iris Classification Project using Python

The Iris dataset is a classic multi-class classification problem in machine learning, where we aim to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their physical characteristics.

Project Overview

In this project, we'll use Python to:

Load and explore the Iris dataset
Preprocess the data
Train and evaluate a classification model
Visualize the results
